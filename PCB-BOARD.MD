### **Conceptual Design: The "Duality Drive" Pedal**
- **Purpose**: A guitar pedal that blends contrasting tones, representing the tension between freedom and control, conflict and resolution.
- **Features**: Combines clean tones (idealism) with distorted, gritty sounds (realism), offering a balance of light and dark.

### **PCB Design Elements**
1. **Circuitry Features**:
   - **Clean Channel**: An op-amp-based clean boost circuit for pure, transparent tones, representing clarity and truth.
   - **Distortion Channel**: A cascading gain stage for warm, overdriven tones, representing struggle and tension.
   - **Blend Knob**: Mixes clean and distorted signals, symbolizing the balance between ideals and reality.
   - **Switchable Modes**: Toggle between "Control" (compressed, precise tones) and "Freedom" (open, dynamic tones).

2. **Symbolic PCB Traces**:
   - Traces shaped as intersecting waves or a web to represent the interconnected conflicts and balances.
   - A yin-yang motif in the copper pour around key components, symbolizing harmony in duality.

3. **Component Placement**:
   - **LED Indicators**: Dual LEDs (white for clean, red for distortion) to show which mode is active.
   - **Capacitors**: Positioned to resemble scales of justice, emphasizing balance.
   - **Potentiometers**: Arranged in a triangular layout to symbolize stability and decision-making.

4. **Aesthetic Design**:
   - A custom silkscreen layer on the PCB with phrases like "Truth," "Freedom," and "Peace" near respective components.
   - Circuit sections named “Ideal” (clean boost) and “Real” (distortion).

5. **Power and Grounding**:
   - Isolated ground planes for noise-free operation, symbolizing clarity amid chaos.

### **Labeling the Controls**:
- **"Truth"**: Clean boost volume.
- **"Tension"**: Distortion intensity.
- **"Balance"**: Blend knob for mixing clean and distorted signals.
- **"Harmony"**: Tone control.
